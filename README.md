It is a little CLI timer to track fasts, designed specifically to help you monitor your fasting intervals.  

## 😮 What's this for? There are a lot of apps like this!

Well, I wrote this one out of annoyance when [Zero](https://www.zerolongevity.com/) once again refused to show me the statistics for a date. I was tapping on the calendar, but the app was doing nothing ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Have no idea what was wrong with it. Anyway, the problem is not that hard, so I just wrote my own timer.

## 🙃 How to install it?

```commandline
pip install fastimer
```

## 🙂 How to use it?

Simply run the script in the directory where you want to store data:

```commandline
fastimer
```

The script shows you a menu with four commands available: 

1. Start New Fast
2. End Active Fast
3. Display Active Fast
4. Display Statistical Data  

Something is obvious: so, the first command starts a new fast, while the second command ends the active one. 

The `Display Active Fast` command shows you how active fast is going on. For instance:

```
Started:        Mon, 20:19
Goal:           Tue, 14:19 (18 hours)

Elapsed time:   04:15
Remaining:      13:44

| #########------------------------------- | 23.7%
```

The `Display Statistical Data` command shows you some statistics & achievement you were able to unlock (total fasting time, average fast length etc.).

## 😌 Where I can see or edit my fasts?

The script stores all the fasts in `fasts.yaml` file in the working directory. The file is quite human-readable, so you can just open it in your lovely text editor.

For instance, the completed fast in the journal looks like this:

```yaml
- length: 16
  started: 2022-07-20 19:59:14.210099
  stopped: 2022-07-21 12:00:33.906634
```

The first parameter is the length of the fast, the second is the start date of this, and the third is the completion date.

For an active fast, the `stopped` parameter is omitted.
