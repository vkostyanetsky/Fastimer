A little console timer to calculate fasting zones.

## 🤨 How to use it?

```commandline
py fastlog.py
```

## 🤩 How does it work? 

It has three simple commands: 

1. Display fast
2. Start fast
3. End fast

What's for the second and the third command is obvious. The first one shows you how started fast is going on. For instance:

```
CURRENT FAST:    16 HOURS

Elapsed time:    00:38:27
Remaining:       15:21:33
        
Started:  Wed, 21:15
Goal:     Thu, 13:15
```
