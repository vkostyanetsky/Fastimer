A little console timer to calculate fasting zones. I wrote this script in a fit of overwhelming annoyance that the Zero once again refused to show me the fasting statistics.

## ü§© How to start it?

There is only script, so the answer is rather obvious:

```commandline
py fastlog.py
```

## üôÉ How does it work? 

Being executed, the script shows you a menu with three commands available: 

1. Display fast
2. Start fast
3. End fast

The first one shows you how started fast is going on. For instance:

```
CURRENT FAST:    16 HOURS

Elapsed time:    00:38:27
Remaining:       15:21:33
        
Started:  Wed, 21:15
Goal:     Thu, 13:15
```

What's for the second command (start fast) and the third one (end fast), requires no explanation.
